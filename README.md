# Headless CMS

This headless CMS is a result of splitting the previous [all-in-one repo containing CMS & website frontend code](https://github.com/vadimgierko/personal-website-next-js) (from September 16 2025) into

- this repo for CMS code &
- [vadimgierko.com repo](https://github.com/vadimgierko/vadimgierko.com) for website frontend code consuming content from the headless CMS.

From September 16 2025 these projects will be maintained separately & [legacy CMS & website frontend repo](https://github.com/vadimgierko/personal-website-next-js) is archived.
